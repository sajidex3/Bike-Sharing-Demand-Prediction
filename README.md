# 🚲 Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts hourly bike rental demand using the Bike Sharing Dataset.

This project demonstrates the full data science workflow:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Model evaluation

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the number of hourly bike rentals based on weather conditions, seasonality, and time-based features.

Understanding demand patterns can help improve resource allocation and operational efficiency in bike-sharing systems.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Regressor
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Analyzed seasonal trends
- Examined impact of temperature and weather
- Visualized hourly demand distribution
- Identified key predictors of rental activity

---

## 🤖 Model Development

- Feature engineering on time and categorical variables
- Train/test split
- Random Forest model training
- Performance evaluation using:
  - RMSE
  - R² Score

---

## 📈 Results

The Random Forest model successfully captured non-linear relationships between weather, time-based variables, and bike demand.

The model demonstrates strong predictive capability and highlights the importance of:
- Temperature
- Hour of day
- Seasonality
